Django Views
------------
Simplest view:
	from django.http import HttpResponse

	def index(request):
		return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the poll index.")
	
Needs a url:
	from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
	from polls import views

	urlpatterns = patterns('',
		url(r'^$', views.index, name='index')
	)	

Site url needs to find it, use an include():
	from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
	from django.contrib import admin
	admin.autodiscover()

	urlpatterns = patterns('',
		url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),
		url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
	)
